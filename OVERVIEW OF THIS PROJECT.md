_**Quiz Game in C**_

This project is a simple text-based Quiz Game implemented in C. The game consists of three levels, with each level containing five multiple-choice questions. To progress through each level, the player must answer at least three questions correctly. The game covers various general knowledge topics such as geography, science, literature, and history.

**How the Game Works**
Levels: There are three levels, each with five questions.
Level 1: Basic general knowledge questions.
Level 2: Intermediate questions covering various topics.
Level 3: Advanced questions that challenge the player further.
Scoring and Progression:

To pass a level, the player must answer at least 3 out of 5 questions correctly.
If the player passes a level, they proceed to the next one.
If the player fails a level, the game ends and displays their final score.
Questions: The questions are stored in arrays, with each question consisting of a text prompt and four possible answers (A, B, C, D). The player selects their answer by typing the corresponding letter.
